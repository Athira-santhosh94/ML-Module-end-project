# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objective
To build regression models that predict car prices in the US market. This helps a Chinese automobile company understand which car features significantly affect price and plan their US market entry strategy accordingly.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Market survey data from the consulting firm
- **Download Link:** [Car Price Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link)
- **File Name:** `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`  
- Contains specifications like car brand, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, dimensions, and more.

## Methods Used
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Encoding Categorical Variables
3. Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling
4. Model Training:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor
5. Model Evaluation (R², MSE, MAE)
6. Feature Importance Analysis
7. Hyperparameter Tuning

## Best Performing Model
** Random Forest Regressor** (or your best model)

## Key Features Affecting Price
- Engine Size  
- Horsepower  
- Car Width  
- Curb Weight  
- Car Brand  

## Results
- Highest R² Score: ~0.91 
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed strong performance.

## Conclusion
The model helps identify pricing drivers in the US car market. This can guide design and marketing strategy for entering the US automotive space.
